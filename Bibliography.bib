	abstract={We present a detailed comparison of theoretical approaches for modeling strong-field ionization by few-cycle laser pulses. The dipole approximation is shown to accurately capture interference structures in photoelectron spectra, while non-dipole effects introduce significant momentum shifts along the propagation direction. Two complementary analytical methods are used: the Jacobi-Anger expansion provides complete spectral decomposition of transition amplitudes, whereas the saddle-point method efficiently identifies dominant ionization pathways. Through this comparative study within the strong-field approximation framework, we establish validity conditions and practical advantages for each approach. Our results provide guidelines for selecting theoretical methods for advancing the interpretation of strong-field processes. These findings provide a roadmap for interpreting strong-field ionization spectra and momentum distributions, highlighting where non-dipole effects and method choice critically alter predictions.}

Then the article develops the three topics which have been central themes of discussion in multiphoton ionization of atoms these past few years: multiply charged ion production, very high order harmonic generation, and above-threshold ionization, a name given to the absorption of a very large number of photons by an already ionized electron. A large part of the review is devoted to some theoretical aspects of multiphoton ionization of atoms and especially non-perturbative theories. Finally the article considers the very near future prospects of laser-electron interactions and more generally laser-matter interactions at 1018-1019 W cm-2, an intensity range now within reach due to new short pulse laser technology.}

Using a complete temporal characterization technique, we demonstrated the compression of the generated pulses for as low as 130 attoseconds, corresponding to less than 1.2 optical cycles. Numerical simulations of the generation process show that the carrier-envelope phase of the attosecond pulses is stable. The availability of single-cycle isolated attosecond pulses opens the way to a new regime in ultrafast physics, in which the strong-field electron dynamics in atoms and molecules is driven by the electric field of the attosecond pulses rather than by their intensity profile.}}

The products of ionization and subsequent dissociation processes are investigated using a time‐of‐flight mass spectrometer equipped with a reflectron (reflecting electric field). Cluster ions containing more than 65 ammonia molecules were formed via internal ion molecule reactions taking place within the initially ionized aggregate. The proton transfer reaction which ensues leads to substantial excess internal energy and subsequent cluster decomposition. Dissociation due to both collisional and unimolecular processes was identified in the field‐free region. Studies of the dynamics of dissociation were made for species up to the protonated 16‐mer; the loss of up to at least five monomer units following cluster ion formation was observed. Results of an investigation of the influence of laser fluence and the energy of the ionizing photons are also presented.},

It is shown that the derived expression for the N-photon T-matrix contains the usual single photon matrix elements given by the perturbation theory and that the perturbative result is obtained in the limit of low intensity. Other explicit examples are considered. The conditions of applicability of the method are specified.}

We present experiments in which metastable xenon atoms were ionized with intense 7-micrometer laser pulses from a free-electron laser. Holographic structures were observed that record underlying electron dynamics on a sublaser-cycle time scale, enabling photoelectron spectroscopy with a time resolution of almost two orders of magnitude higher than the duration of the ionizing pulse.}

New results obtained in a space-charge-free regime are reported. The intensity dependences of the spectra show a clear departure from the predictions of lowest-order perturbation theory. At short pulse duration (50 psec) the peaks appear red shifted, and the effect is amplified in circular polarization. A possible interpretation of this effect in terms of ponderomotive potentials is proposed.}

Systematic analysis of the experimental data that are quantitatively reproduced by numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with integration over the laser focal volume demonstrates the dominance of resonance-enhanced ionization. Continuous variation of the laser wavelength allows the identification of a number of consecutive channel-switching effects with a reliable assignment of the intermediate Rydberg states involved. The appearance of the resonant sub-structure in the electron energy spectra is influenced by the presence of a non-resonant contribution. At relatively low laser intensity, a coherent addition of resonant and non-resonant ionization processes is observed. Due to the absence of an intensity dependence in the resonance-enhanced ionization, we observe the persistence of Freeman resonances at the transition to the tunnelling regime.}

abstract = {The photoelectron emission spectra generated by the interaction between ultrashort intense laser pulses and atoms can reveal the ultrafast dynamics of electrons. By using the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation in momentum space, the photoelectron emission spectra of atoms irradiated by 400 nm intense lasers with different durations of the pulse has been investigated. In the photoelectron emission spectrum, in addition to the above-threshold ionization peaks due to ionization interference in multiple cycles and the sideband peaks mainly due to the interference of ionized electrons at different moments along the rising edge of the laser pulse envelope, additional peaks of photoelectron emission whose intensity appears to oscillate with the increasing duration of the laser pulse can also be observed. Based on strong-field approximation and the population's analysis of the bound state, it is found that these photoelectron peaks originate from the ionization of the excited state and the oscillations of these peaks are due to the superposition of their peak energy positions with the sideband energy positions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the energy positions of the maximum intensity of the photoelectron emission spectra move towards the higher energy end as the duration of the driving laser pulse extends. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the main moment of ionization of atoms changes with the increasing duration of the driving laser pulse, thus allowing the real-time ionization of atoms to be probed using photoelectron emission spectra.},

abstract = {The photoelectric effect describes the ejection of an electron upon absorption of one or several photons. The kinetic energy of this electron is determined by the photon energy reduced by the binding energy of the electron and, if strong laser fields are involved, by the ponderomotive potential in addition. It has therefore been widely taken for granted that for atoms and molecules, the photoelectron energy does not depend on the electron’s emission direction, but theoretical studies have questioned this since 1990. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the energies of photoelectrons emitted against the light propagation direction are shifted toward higher values, while those electrons that are emitted along the light propagation direction are shifted to lower values. We attribute the energy shift to a nondipole contribution to the ponderomotive potential that is due to the interaction of the moving electrons with the incident photons. The electron energy peaks for multiphoton processes depend on the emission direction, which confirms a 30-year-old prediction.}

journal = {Laser Physics Letters},
abstract = {Coulomb-corrected strong-field approximation (CCSFA), which integrates Coulomb potential and the interference effects, is a semiclassical method successful in the study of atomic strong-field ionization. However, it is difficult to numerically solve the saddle-point equation describing tunnelling in the CCSFA, especially for complex laser fields such as elliptically or orthogonally polarized two-color laser fields. In this work, we propose an efficient method based on the genetic algorithm (CCSFA-GA) to overcome this difficulty. The accuracy of our method is verified by comparing our result with the calculation of the standard CCSFA on a hydrogen atom, subjected to an intense laser field. Moreover, we show that the result of the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with an elliptically polarized laser field can be well reproduced by the CCSFA-GA.}

New results obtained in a space-charge-free regime are reported. The intensity dependences of the spectra show a clear departure from the predictions of lowest-order perturbation theory. At short pulse duration (50 psec) the peaks appear red shifted, and the effect is amplified in circular polarization. A possible interpretation of this effect in terms of ponderomotive potentials is proposed.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The interaction of intense mid-infrared laser fields with atoms and molecules leads to a range of new opportunities, from the production of bright, coherent radiation in the soft x-ray range, to imaging molecular structures and dynamics with attosecond temporal and sub-angstrom spatial resolution. However, all these effects, which rely on laser-driven recollision of an electron removed by the strong laser field and its parent ion, suffer from the rapidly increasing role of the magnetic field component of the driving pulse: the associated Lorentz force pushes the electrons off course in their excursion and suppresses all recollision-based processes, including high harmonic generation as well as elastic and inelastic scattering. Here we show how the use of two non-collinear beams with opposite circular polarizations produces a forwards ellipticity which can be used to monitor, control, and cancel the effect of the Lorentz force. This arrangement can thus be used to re-enable recollision-based phenomena in regimes beyond the long-wavelength breakdown of the dipole approximation, and it can be used to observe this breakdown in high harmonic generation using currently available light sources.}

abstract = {We investigate the angular distribution of electrons that are emitted in the ionization of hydrogen-like ions by twisted photons. Analysis is performed based on the first-order perturbation theory and the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Special attention is paid to the dependence of the electron emission pattern on the impact parameter b of the ion with respect to the centre of the twisted wave front. In order to explore such a dependence, detailed calculations were carried out for the photoionization of the 1s ground and 2 py excited states of neutral hydrogen atoms. Based on these calculations, we argue that for relatively small impact parameters, the electron angular distributions may be strongly affected by altering the position of the atom within the wave front. In contrast, if the atom is placed far from the front centre, the emission pattern of the electrons is independent of the impact parameter b and resembles that observed in the photoionization by plane wave photons.}

  abstract = {The theoretical description and the experimental methods and results for above-threshold ionization (ATI) by few-cycle pulses are reviewed. A pulse is referred to as a few-cycle pulse if its detailed shape, parametrized by its carrier-envelope phase, affects its interaction with matter. Angular-resolved ATI spectra are analysed with the customary strong-field approximation (SFA) as well as the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE). After a general discussion of the characteristics and the description of few-cycle pulses, the behaviour of the ATI spectrum under spatial inversion is related to the shape of the laser field. The ATI spectrum both for the direct and for the rescattered electrons in the context of the SFA is evaluated by numerical integration and by the method of steepest descent (saddle-point integration), and the results are compared. The saddle-point method is modified to avoid the singularity of the dipole transition matrix element at the steepest-descent times. With the help of the saddle-point method and its classical limit, namely the simple-man model, the various features of the ATI spectrum, their behaviour under inversion, the cut-offs and the presence or absence of ATI peaks are analysed as a function of the carrier-envelope phase of the few-cycle laser field. All features observed in the spectra can be explained in terms of a few quantum orbits and their superposition. The validity of the SFA and the concept of quantum orbits are established by comparing the ATI spectra with those obtained numerically from the ab initio solution of the TDSE.}

The focus is on the fundamentals of the theory, its most important applications and those aspects which still raise difficulties and remain under discussion. The Keldysh theory is compared with other nonperturbative analytic methods of strong field atomic physics and its important generalizations are discussed. Among the difficulties, the gauge invariance problem, the tunneling time concept, the conditions of applicability and the application of the theory to ionization of systems more complex than atoms, including molecules and dielectrics, are considered. Possible prospects for the future development of the theory are also discussed.}

At the same time, Julia allows programmers to control memory layout and leverages a specializing just-in-time compiler to eliminate much of the overhead of those features. This paper details the design choices made by the creators of Julia and reflects on the implications of those choices for performance and usability.},

  abstract = {The energy spectra of electrons produced in multiphoton ionization of rare gases display a large number of peaks corresponding to the absorption of much more than a minimum number of photons required to ionize the atom. A retarding-potential method has been used to analyze the energy of electrons produced in the multiphoton ionization of He, Ne, and Xe at 1064 and 532 nm in a broad range of laser intensities (10^13–10^15 W cm^−2). The intensity dependence of energetic electrons emphasizes the validity of the IM law, where M is the total number of photons absorbed. The shape of the electron energy distribution can be completely changed when the laser intensity is increased. The maximum of the energy distribution is switched from the slowest electron peak to faster electron peaks. The distortion of the energy distribution is generally strongly asymmetric, with a steep gradient at the low-energy edge. At 1064 nm, this leads to the disappearance of the first peak in Xe at 4 × 10^13 W cm^−2, whereas in Ne the first three peaks disappear at 4.3 × 10^14 W cm^−2 and the first thirteen peaks disappear at 7.8 × 10^14 W cm^−2. These effects are still more marked in He in comparison with other higher-Z atoms. The present experimental results could be explained by a model based on continuum–continuum transitions.}

  abstract = 	{Strong laser fields are a valuable tool to study the electron dynamics in atoms and molecules. A prominent strong-field process is the above-threshold ionization (ATI). Recent advances in the generation of intense laser beams at mid-infrared wavelengths enable the investigation of ATI in a new parameter range. Moreover, laser beams with a sophisticated spatial structure as a result of an orbital angular momentum (twisted light) have found applications in the strong-field regime. In this dissertation, we theoretically investigate ATI driven by mid-infrared and twisted light beams. We show that their spatial dependence has a pronounced impact on the ionization dynamics due to nondipole interactions. Therefore, we develop a general theoretical approach to ATI that incorporates this spatial structure: in order to extend the strong-field approximation (SFA), we construct nondipole Volkov states which describe the photoelectron continuum dressed by the laser field. The resulting nondipole SFA allows the treatment of ATI driven by spatially structured laser fields. We apply this SFA to the ATI driven by plane-wave laser beams and show that peak shifts in the photoelectron momentum distributions can be computed in good agreement with experiments. As a second application, we consider the ATI driven by standing waves, known as high-intensity Kapitza-Dirac effect. Here, we calculate the momentum transfer to photoelectrons for elliptically polarized standing waves and demonstrate that low- and high-energy photoelectrons exhibit different angular distributions. Finally, we investigate the ATI of localized atomic targets driven by few-cycle Bessel pulses. We demonstrate that the photoelectrons can be emitted along the propagation direction of the pulse owing to longitudinal electric field components. Moreover, the ATI spectra depend on both the opening angle and the orbital angular momentum of the Bessel pulse. We also discuss the extension of this work towards long pulses.},

title = {Counterintuitive angular shifts in the photoelectron momentum distribution for atoms in strong few-cycle circularly polarized laser pulses},
journal = {Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics},
abstract = {We solve the three-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a three-cycle circularly polarized laser pulse interacting with an atom. The photoelectron momentum distributions show counterintuitive shifts, similar to those observed in a recent experiment (Eckle et al 2008 Science 322 1525). The physical origin of the shifts is examined by a detailed investigation of the wave packet after the pulse. We show that the shifts arise as a consequence of an intimate interplay between the external field and the binding potential, and that the shifts occur also at lower intensities than used in the experiment, corresponding to the multiphoton regime. In contrast to the recent experiment we do not invoke the concept of a tunnelling time in our explanation of the shifts.}
